- I'm Ollie - I'm currently learning about Aerosols at the Aersol Science CDT.

- From May 2023 I'll be in Manchester, looking at whether in-situ imager can observe complex ice-cloud structures.

- Then, from Summer 2023, I'll be working on the impact of aircraft emissions and alternative fuels on condensation trail formation, especially looking at satellite imagery and models.
